WRITTEN REPORT

Summary
This analysis was conducted using Pandas. I analyzed the relationship between school performance and total school budget. I categorized schools into spending ranges to observe how spending levels impact academic performance. I did this analysis by considering school type, school size, per student budget and total school budget. I also evaluated students’ average math and reading scores, the percentage of students who passed math, reading, or both. 

Comparisons and Conclusions
1. 	Increased Spending Does Not Guarantee Higher Performance  
From my observation, schools with higher total budget did not show significantly better academic performance. Surprisingly, schools with lower total budget had a higher percentage of students passing math and reading. This suggests that increasing spending doesn’t necessarily result in good performance. There might be a need to focus more on the quality of teachers in these schools. 

2.	Charter Schools Have Better Overall Passing Score Compared to District Schools
The analysis shows that charter schools have better overall passing score compared to district schools. They also have lesser student count (between 400 to 2300). We can conclude that students that attend charter schools get more academic support from their teachers. There might be a need to channel the spending of district schools towards employing more teachers to match the student population.
